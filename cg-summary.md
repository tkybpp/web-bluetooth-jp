# WEB BLUETOOTH COMMUNITY GROUP

Bluetooth is a standard for short-range wireless communication between devices.
This group is developing a
[specification for Bluetooth APIs](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) to
allow websites to communicate with devices in a secure and privacy-preserving way.
In particular the web Bluetooth API focuses on
minimizing the device attack surface exposed to malicious websites,
possibly by removing access to
some existing Bluetooth features that are hard to implement securely.
Further, the API takes the approach of a user interface to
select and approve access to devices as opposed to using certification and installation.

Most of our activity happens in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth),
with supporting code in adjacent repositories in the
[WebBluetoothCG GitHub organization](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG).
